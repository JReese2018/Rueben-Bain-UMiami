As a Data Specialist in the field of Sport Science, we are sometimes have to plan ahead in situations that can be uncomfortable. My Assistant Director, gave me a hypothetical to find a replacement for one of our football players. After receiving a dataset with over 180 potential replacements for one of our defensive linemen, I ran off to find "the guy"

The idea was to find a similar player to our guy. There are different algorithms that can be used to get to some insights. This project, I used Euclidean's Distance to get to an answer. This process was facilitated using the Python packages Pandas and the Machine Learning tool, SciKit Learn.

After all of the analysis, I used Matplotlib, Photoshop, and Google Docs for the visualization giving overviews on each prospect that I believed would be good fits for our program.
